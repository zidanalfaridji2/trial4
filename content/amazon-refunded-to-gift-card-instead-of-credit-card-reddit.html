        <p>Amazon refunded to gift card instead of credit card. In short, it states that a seller can “treat” you a broken or very cheap item instead of initiating the return that may be more costly than the item itself. You will need to call amazon. Adding funds to your amazon.com gift card balance is now easier and faster. I went target store ask for could get cash or money back to my account instead of get store credit.</p>
