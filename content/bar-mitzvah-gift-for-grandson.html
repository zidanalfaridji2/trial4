        <p>What is an appropriate bar mitzvah gift for our grandson? To become a bar mitzvah, this jewish boy will need a few items to assist him : Congratulations on becoming a man! The torah pointer or yad is used as an extension of your hand to follow along in the torah reading in order that your hand does not touch the torah. If you are giving a gift for two or four people, you can spend $54 or more at least.</p>
