        <p>You can never go wrong with money presents, in jewish tradition if you’re going to give money, a meaningful number is 18 because in hebrew it has the same numerical value as the word chai,meaning “ life”. With this in mind, $180 (10×18), $324 (18×18, so extra credit here!), and $360 (20×18) seem to be the best amounts for bar mitzvah gifts if you decide not to give a real present. My husband and i and our two boys are flying to new jersey in a few weeks to attend. Guests at a bar mitzvah party typically bring gifts, such as cash, to celebrate the milestone. Spending money on gift cards or savings bonds is not the best course of action if you only have a child attending the bar mitzvah.</p>

        <p>So, if you are giving the recipient a multiple of 18 then you are symbolically giving him a gift of. I have never been to one before, but a jewish friend of mine told me that i should be honored and definitely go. My husband and i and our two boys are flying to new jersey in a few weeks to attend. It is also completely acceptable to round to normal. In jewish tradition the number 18 symbolizes “chai” or the hebrew word for “life”.</p>
